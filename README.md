# ThreeJS Workshop

An introductory workshop for integrating 3D models into web browsers.

## Description

Internet browsers have come a long way since the days of Netscape. Today they host web-based apps, process tremendous data in real-time, and (perhaps most interestingly for designers) offer a range of interactive tools. Websites can host immersive 3D experiences using VR and AR applications and render photorealistic models almost as accurately as any 3D software. It appears to be a good time for designers to embrace the browser as a space not just for exhibiting work, but for experimenting as well.

This workshop will introduce students to a workflow for making 3D models that can be shared on the web and viewed in internet browsers. Using the web-based programming language JavaScript and a 3D library called ThreeJS, students will learn the basics of making a simple interactive 3D model viewer in a browser. Students will be introduced to basic JavaScript syntax and specifically the logic for piecing together a ThreeJS script that can load a 3D model.

No previous coding experience required.
